I started by opening Pycharm as the IDE and familiarizing myself with the API. I used the JSON library and the requests library since that was the type of data being processed


FIrst thing I wanted to do was get the user information so I started thinkering with inputs and getting the user information to display. I assumed that loan info would be tied to users, and I had to double check the API in order to swap the links.
I took a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12965203/how-to-get-json-from-webpage-into-python-script
